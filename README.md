Please ignore, nothing to see. 

SCala Yummy THrift Engine
=========================

An experiment to see whether a Scala based thrift compiler/code generator can generate
code closer to Scala-ness. I'm not extending the Thrift C++ compiler because, frankly,
I can't be bothered. 


Building
========

Use SBT 0.11.1. SBT is a <expletives deleted> so don't count on any other
version working. 

No main at the moment, so peek around in the tests :)
